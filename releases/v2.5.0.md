### üîß Improvements

- **Logs Handling**: Agents are now sending only ERROR and above logs by default to server. Log retention is reduced from 30days to 15days to reduce the db storage cost. [details](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/n-encyclopedia/logging/#step-2-configure-logging)
- **Trim Large Activities**: Large (>10K) inputs and outputs of activities histories are now removed from the database to reduce the db storage cost.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with KeyCloak authentication in UI Portal not letting admin to delete agent definitions.
- Resolved a bug stopping agents sutting down when Ctrl+C is pressed.

### Breaking Changes

- **/api/user/rest/converse REST API response**: The data response recieved from this api endpoint returned the data wrapped in a `response` object. Now this wrapper is removed. Any previous response handling call such as `response.json().response.data` should be changed to `response.json().data`
